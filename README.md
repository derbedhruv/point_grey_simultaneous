# point_grey_simultaneous
A useful utility written using Flycapture2 SDK to be able to take images one after another from two Point grey Blackfly BFLY-U3-13S2C cameras. This was not working using the inbuilt MultipleCameraEx example and hence this was modified. This should be useful to anyone who wanted to talk to multiple USB3 cameras at once. Also this works perfectly fine through USB2.0 as well.
